Based on the data we can see that:
- There were 94 vine reviews and 40471 non-vine reviews.
- Of the vine reviews 48 had 5 stars, and of the non-vine 15663 had 5 star reviews
- 51% of the vine reviews had 5 stars, and 38.7% of the non-vine reviews had 5 stars

## Summary

As we can see in the results of vine reviewed and non-vine reviewed games, those that have a vine review are more likely to have 5 stars. In order to further support if this result is statistically significant, we could do t tests on the aggregates for multiple vine reviewed products against the same non-vine reviewed products. Based on the Statistical review we would be able to see if there was a statistical significane to the amount of 5 star vine reveiewed products and if it was worth supporting the program further.
